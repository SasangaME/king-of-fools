# King of the Fools

## Use Case

Please write a solidity program called "King of the fools".

It works like this - You can deposit ether or usdc into a smart contract, as long as it's at least 1.5x more money than the previous person. If you do that, you become "King of the fools", and your money gets sent back to the previous person.

Please write the contract with simple UI(doesn't have to be beautiful), following the highest code standards you would usually follow.
